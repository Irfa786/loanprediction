'''''''LOAN APPROVAL STATUS PREDICTION USING SVM'''''''


The project focuses on using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is a type of supervised machine learning model, to predict the status of loans. The project will involve collecting a dataset of historical loan data and preprocessing it to ensure it is suitable for SVM algorithms. The SVM model will then be trained and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics.

The project will involve several key steps. Firstly, the historical loan data will be collected and preprocessed, which may involve cleaning and transforming the data to make it compatible with SVM algorithms which includes label encoding. Then, the SVM model will be trained using labeled data, where the loan status (approved or rejected) is known. The model will be fine-tuned using techniques such as hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance.

Once the SVM model is trained and validated, it can be used to predict the status of new loan applications. The model will take into account various features such as Gender,Married,Dependents,Education,Self employed to determine the likelihood of loan approval. This prediction can be used by lenders to make informed decisions on loan applications, potentially improving the efficiency of loan processing and risk assessment. The project has the potential to contribute to the field of finance by providing a predictive tool for loan status prediction using SVM, a powerful supervised learning model.

I have also deployed a web application using streamlit platform to get a better user interface.
